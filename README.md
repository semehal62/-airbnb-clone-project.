# Airbnb-clone-project
## Overview of the project
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions,
property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.
## Goal of the project
  * User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  * Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
  * Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
  * Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
  * Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
  * Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
## Technology Stack
  * Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
  * Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
  * PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
  * GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
  * Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
  * Redis: Used for caching and session management.
  * Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
  * CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
## Team Roles
 * Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic or we can generalize it as  the core of an app—its        algorithms and business logic.
 * Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
 * DevOps Engineer: serve as a link between the two teams developemetn and opration team, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping     strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable.
 * QA Engineer: verifys whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional.
