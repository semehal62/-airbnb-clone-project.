# Airbnb-clone-project
## Overview of the project
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions,
property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.
## Goal of the project
  * User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  * Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
  * Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
  * Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
  * Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
  * Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
## Technology Stack
  * Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
  * Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
  * PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
  * GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
  * Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
  * Redis: Used for caching and session management.
  * Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
  * CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
## Team Roles
 * Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic or we can generalize it as  the core of an app—its        algorithms and business logic.
 * Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
 * DevOps Engineer: serve as a link between the two teams developemetn and opration team, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping     strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable.
 * QA Engineer: verifys whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional.
## Database Design
### Entities
* Users
    
    GET /users/ - List all users
  
    POST /users/ - Create a new user
  
    GET /users/{user_id}/ - Retrieve a specific user
  
    PUT /users/{user_id}/ - Update a specific user
  
    DELETE /users/{user_id}/ - Delete a specific user
  
* Properties

   GET /properties/ - List all properties
  
   POST /properties/ - Create a new property
  
   GET /properties/{property_id}/ - Retrieve a specific property
  
   PUT /properties/{property_id}/ - Update a specific property
  
   DELETE /properties/{property_id}/ - Delete a specific property
  
* Bookings

   GET /bookings/ - List all bookings
  
   POST /bookings/ - Create a new booking

   GET /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Retrieve a specific booking

   PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Update a specific booking

   DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Delete a specific booking

* Payments

   POST /payments/ - Process a payment

* Reviews
   
   GET /reviews/ - List all reviews
  
   POST /reviews/ - Create a new review
  
   GET /reviews/{review_id}/ - Retrieve a specific review

   DELETE /reviews/{review_id}/ - Delete a specific review

## Feature Breakdown

1. API Documentation
   
   OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.

   Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.

   GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

2. User Authentication

   User Authentication handles user registration, login, and profile management through endpoints /users/ and /users/{user_id}/. It enables
   
   users to create accounts, authenticate their identity, and manage their personal information.

4. Property Management

   Property managment handles creating, updating, retrieve, and delete property listings through endpoints /properties/ and /properties/{property_id}/

5. Booking System

   Booking system handles making , updating , and manages bookings, including check-in and check-out details through endpoints  /bookings/ and

   /bookings/{booking_id}/

8. Payment Processing
 
   Payment Processing handles payment transactions related to bookings through  endpoint /payments/

5. Review System

   Review system manages and posts reviews throug the endpoints  /reviews/ and  /reviews/{review_id}/

6. Database Optimizations
    
   Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of requently accessed data.
  
   Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
## API Security

* Authentication: Verifying user identities to ensure only authorized users can access their accounts and sensitive data.
* Authorization: Controlling user permissions to restrict access to specific features or data based on their roles.
* Rate Limiting: Restricting the number of requests a user can make within a certain period to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.
* Protecting user data: Keeps personal info confidential and maintains trust.
* Securing payments: Prevents fraud and protects financial details.
* Controlling access: Stops unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.
* Preventing abuse: Ensures system stability and reliable service.
